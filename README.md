## Overview

Try to avoid the obstacles! In this game, you control a ball and avoid falling objects from the sky. Each time an object falls to the ground without hitting the player, you gain points. The goal is to collect a total of 25 points to unlock the next level. The game features 3 different levels, each with unique themes and increasing difficulty.

## Deployment

The game is live at the following URL: 

## Instructions

The user is greeted with a starting screen featuring a brief game description and level selection. Initially, only Level 1 is accessible. By progressing through the game, players can unlock subsequent levels. The unlocked levels are stored in the device's local storage, ensuring data persists across browser sessions.

By selecting a level, the game screen appears. The ball can be controlled using:

- **Desktop Keyboard**: Arrow keys or the A and D keys.
- **Mobile Devices**: Tapping the right or left side of the screen.

Avoid all obstacles and aim to score 25 points! If you get hit by an obstacle, a retry screen will appear. Successfully scoring 25 points will lead to a congratulatory screen with a button to access the next level. After completing Level 3, the final screen provides a link to the homepage, where you can freely explore all three levels.
